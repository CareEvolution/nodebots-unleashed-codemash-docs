## How to claim your Photon as your own
We've released all of the photons from our account, so now the chips are yours.  You will need to create an account with Particle and [provision your chip as your own](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/start/photon/).  You will get a new API key, so don't forget to update your JavaScript code with the new API key and name!

You will also need to re-add [VoodooSpark](https://github.com/voodootikigod/voodoospark) to the board so that Johnny-Five can communicate with it!

## Welcome to NodeBots Unleashed @ CodeMash!
### January 5th & 6th, 2016 at [CodeMash](http://www.codemash.org)
NodeBots are back, and this time, the cord has been cut! Armed with a wireless microcontroller, MacGyver-like circuitry, cheap wood, JavaScript, and your wits, can you compete like a champion? Engage your brain by building in three domains: software, electronics, and mechanics. Compete for NodeBot supremacy by innovating to give your bot the edge over your competition. This precompiler is an all-day, hands-on, immersive experience. You donâ€™t need to have any Node.js, mechanical, or electronics experience. There will be coaches and pairs to work with you! Whose NodeBot will reign supreme? 

Feeling less competitive? Hack on any awesome idea you have. There will be all sorts of components, tools, and building materials to make something cool.

**All participants will be required to sign a liability waiver.**
