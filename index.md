## Welcome to NodeBots Unleashed @ CodeMash!
### January 5th & 6th, 2016 at [CodeMash](http://www.codemash.org)
NodeBots are back, and this time, the cord has been cut! Armed with a wireless microcontroller, MacGyver-like circuitry, cheap wood, JavaScript, and your wits, can you compete like a champion? Engage your brain by building in three domains: software, electronics, and mechanics. Compete for NodeBot supremacy by innovating to give your bot the edge over your competition. This precompiler is an all-day, hands-on, immersive experience. You donâ€™t need to have any Node.js, mechanical, or electronics experience. There will be coaches and pairs to work with you! Whose NodeBot will reign supreme? 

Feeling less competitive? Navigate our autonomous test track, or hack on any awesome idea you have. There will be all sorts of components, tools, and building materials to make something cool.

**All participants will be required to [sign a liability waiver]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Nodebots Ann Arbor Waiver.pdf)**
