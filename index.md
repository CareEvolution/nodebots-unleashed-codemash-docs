Armed with an Arduino, MacGyver-like circuitry, cheap wood, and JavaScript, can you rise to the call of battle? Engage your brain by building in three dimensions: software, electronics, and hardware. Innovate to give your bot the edge over your competition and battle for NodeBot supremacy. This is an all-day, hands-on, immersive experience. You don’t need to have any Node.js, hardware, or electronics experience — there will be coaches and pairs to work with you! Whose NodeBot will reign supreme?

Don’t feel like competing? We’ll have all sorts of platforms, boards, components, supplies, etc for hacking robots however you want.

**All participants will be required to [sign a liability waiver]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Nodebots Ann Arbor Waiver.pdf)**

We will also be taking photos for the event, so we have a [photo release form]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/PhotographandPublicityConsentReleaseForm.pdf)
