<a name="nodejs"></a>
## Node.js (required) 
This is the only required software.  These are [NodeBots](http://nodebots.io) so they require [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) to run. Node is a JavaScript runtime based on the V8 engine.  It is how you will be running the code today.  Just download and install it.

- [OSX](https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.2.3/node-v4.2.3.pkg)
- [Windows 32bit](https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.2.3/node-v4.2.3-x86.msi)
- [Windows 64bit](https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.2.3/node-v4.2.3-x64.msi)

<a name="git"></a>
## Git (recommended)
The open source community runs on [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](http://github.com).  All of our examples as well as anything else you are likely to want to bring in will be on Git.  Because of this, we recommend that you have Git.  You can get away with not installing it if you prefer -- you can just download Zip files from GitHub -- so it is optional.  If you don't already have Git installed, we recommend installing the GitHub client on Windows.  For the Mac, open up a command line and type `git --version`.  If it is already installed, you will get a version back.  If not, OSX will ask you to install the necessary components automatically.

- [Windows](https://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHubSetup.exe)

<a name="sublime"></a>
## Sublime Text (optional)
You need a text editor.  Chances are that you already have one that you like.  If not, try Sublime Text.  It is pretty nice.
