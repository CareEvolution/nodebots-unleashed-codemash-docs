Our competition event for International NodeBots Day in Ann Arbor will be "Battle Bots", also known as "Sumo Bots".  Battle bots will compete in head-to-head battles, much like a wrestling or sumo match.  The aim is for one bot to push the opponents bot out of the arena.

**Here are the rules**

0. Build your bot however you want, but use the two continuous servos as your primary drive mechanism.
0. The arena is an octagon, 1 meter wide, on carpet.
0. You have one minute to knock your opponent completely out of the arena.  This is considered a KO.
0. If after one minute, a KO is not achieved, the bot with their Arduino closest to the center dot wins.
0. All rules are subject to interpetation by the referees, and all decisions by the referees are final.

You have full access to the maker space.  If you build the reference kit, you are very unlikely to win.  You need to innovate.  What kinds of modifications can you make to give yourself an advantage? What strategies will help you win?

There can be only one true king of the battle bots ring; will it be your bot?

**Here are some examples of NodeBots battling it out**
