[CareEvolution](http://letsfixhealthcare.com/) is a healthcare IT company who is trying to fix healthcare as we know it.  What do tiny JavaScript-powered robots have to do with healthcare?  It is all about culture.  We believe that hacking is an important part of exploring new ideas and concepts.  Every 8 weeks, we hold a "hackathon" where we encourage our employees to try something new.  Sometimes, we introduce a new visualization into our product line.  Other times, we evalutate a new technology.

Programming robots?  Sure!  Designing robots requires you to think, design, and debug in multiple dimensions.  By tackling problems in software, electronics, and the physical world, you are forcing yourself to think differently than you do every day.  That exercise relaxes your brain so that when it comes time to solve problems in your day job, you are more creative and more likely to think about problems from a different perspective.

If a culture like this sounds interesting to you, we encourage you to talk to us and help us: [LetsFixHealthcare.com](http://letsfixhealthcare.com/).

[Quantum Signal](http://quantumsignal.com/) has worked with clients ranging from single-person companies to the multinational conglomerates and governments, and succeeded on each and every project we have executed. We never worry whether or not potential customers contact those for which we've worked with in the past, because they are usually our best salespeople! Our organization has an advertising budget of (essentially) zero - our customers and technology speak for themselves, and we're growing fast!

[Menlo Innovations](http://menloinnovations.com/) Menlo Innovations' clients hire them to design and build custom software.

Their CEO, Richard Sheridan, elaborates on this by describing:
"We are like a custom homebuilder. If you have the house of your dreams in mind, you would want to find an architectural firm, a design firm, and a build firm to bring it to life." We do the same thing for software.
